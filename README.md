### Create new issue




### Creating a new branch

Make sure in master using git branch
```
$ git branch
```

Before creating a new branch, pull the changes from upstream. Your master needs to be up to date.
```
$ git pull
```

Create the branch on your local machine and switch in this branch :
```
$ git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]
```

Push the branch on github :
```
$ git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch]
```
